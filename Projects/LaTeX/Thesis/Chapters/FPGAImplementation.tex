\section{Tools Used}
% Todo: Review Vivado edition
This work's CNN inference accelerator was implemented and optimized for FPGA platforms using the Xilinx Vivado Design Suite - HL System Edition 2019.1 \cite{Vivado-Design-Suite}. Vivado Design Suite is a software suite developed by Xilinx for its FPGA devices for analysis and synthesis of Hardware Description Language (HDL) designs, written in VHDL or Verilog. It is superseding Xilinx ISE \cite{Xilinx-ISE}, as a complete rewrite, with additional features for System-on-Chip (SoC) design and High-Level Synthesis (HLS). The tools used in this work are Xilinx Vivado HLS, Xilinx Vivado IDE, and Xilinx SDK.

\subsection{Vivado IDE}
Xilinx Vivado Integrated Design Environment (IDE), released in 2012, is the basis for all Xilinx tools. It serves as a GUI front-end for the Vivado Design Suite. All Vivado Design Suite tools integrate a native TCL interface, which can be accessed from IDE's GUI and the TCL console. Vivado IDE can compile, synthesize, implement, place and route FPGA hardware designs written in high-level languages such as C/C++, and HDLs such as VHDL and Verilog.

In addition, using the IP Integrator tool, hardware systems can be designed by graphically connecting IP blocks and configuring them through their GUI, with no coding involved, hence, accelerating the design process. Integration automation features such as auto-connecting and auto-configuring blocks further accelerate the design process. IP blocks can be created using the integrated IP Packaging functionality for VHDL or Verilog designs and via the Xilinx HLS tool for C/C++ designs. Xilinx also provides many IP blocks for free, including but not limited to on and off-chip-network IPs, memory blocks and memory management IPs, I/O interface IPs, and even various compute IPs. There are also additional IP's that can be purchased from Xilinx or even other vendors and developers.

After the design process is completed, a bitstream can be created and then downloaded to the target FPGA device to run as a standalone hardware device or in combination with firmware running on the FPGA's integrated ARM cores. The device's firmware is developed, compiled, and deployed using the Xilinx Software Development Kit (SDK) tool.

Designs can be tested on IP level or ever system-wide using the IDE's integrated simulator or any other RTL simulator. Moreover, Vivado IDE provides various debug tools that, combined with Integrated Logic Analyzer (ILA) IPs, can scan, check, and visualize the system's behavior during runtime.

\subsection{Vivado High-Level Synthesis (HLS)}
Xilinx Vivado High-Level Synthesis (HLS) \cite{Vivado-Design-Suite-User-Guide-High-Level-Synthesis}, currently rebranded as Xilinx Vitis HLS, is a tool included in the Xilinx Vivado Design Suite, allowing for a higher level of abstraction design of HDL systems. Vivado HLS synthesizes C/C++, SystemC and OpenCL functions into IP blocks, generating their VHDL and Verilog HDL designs that can then be implemented into hardware systems using Vivado and its Block Design tool.

While HLS accepts non-hardware-optimized code, it provides a set of directives that can instruct the synthesis procedure to implement a specific behavior, optimization, and resource management. Directives are optional and do not affect the input code's behavior. Their usage can both benefit the generated IP's performance and even hurt it when not used correctly. Furthermore, constraints, like clock period, clock uncertainty, and FPGA target, are added to the HLS synthesized IP blocks to ensure the desired behavior and performance.

A C/C++ testbench is used to debug the input code's behavior prior to synthesis, which should feed the input code with test data and check its output for correctness. Verification of the exported IP block is done using the C/RTL Cosimulation functionality, which uses the same C/C++ testbench, but replaces the function's call with the exported IP block call.

\subsubsection{Synthesis Report}
A synthesis report is created whenever HLS successfully synthesizes an IP Block, showing various performance and resource utilization metrics. Using the synthesis report, the designer can easily find and target the bottleneck to further optimize their design in terms of both performance and resources. Since Vitis HLS 2020.1, the report summary also contains the aforementioned information per loop per module, making the optimization procedure even more targeted. Some of the metrics are presented and explained below.

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Latency:} The number of clock cycles required for a complete run of a module or loop.
	\item \textbf{Iteration Latency:} The number of clock cycles required for running a single iteration of a module or loop.
	\item \textbf{Iteration/Initiation Interval (II):} The number of clock cycles required before a module can accept new input or a loop can initiate a new iteration.
	\item \textbf{Pipelined:} Whether a module or loop is implemented using a pipelined architecture.
	\item \textbf{Area:} The number of hardware resources a module requires for its implementation into the target FPGA. The hardware resource types are Block RAM (BRAM) and Ultra RAM (URAM), Digital Signal Processing (DSP) units, Flip Flops (FF), and Lookup Tables (LUT). A table is also given on the detailed report, showing the number of hardware resources required for every hardware component type, which include DSPs, Expressions, First-In-First-Out (FIFO) queues, Instances, Memories, Multiplexers, and Registers.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Optimization Directives}
As mentioned above, HLS provides a set of directives for design optimization in terms of latency, throughput, and resource utilization of the exported IP block. Those directives can be added directly into the input code in the form of pragmas that the preprocessor can read. Another way of adding directives is by creating a new solution and automatically adding them to it. Every solution combines a set of directives and configurations into TCL files, one TCL file per solution. Multiple solutions can be created, each with different directive combinations and configurations. This way allows for better experimentation and fine-tuning of the design. Some optimization directives are presented and explained below.

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Interface:} The top-level function's arguments have to be mapped to RTL ports to configure the IP block's functionality. The interface directive specifies each argument's port type.
	\item \textbf{Stream:} By default, the top-level function's array arguments are implemented as RAM channels. However, when data are being produced or consumed sequentially, a more efficient data type is to use FIFOs, which can be specified using the stream directive.
	\item \textbf{Pipeline:} Given an \emph{Initiation Interval (II)} parameter, the pipeline directive reduces the number of clock cycles a function or loop can accept new inputs, targeting \emph{II} clock cycles, by allowing the overlapped execution of operations.
	\item \textbf{Unroll:} Given a \emph{factor}, the unroll directive unrolls a loop \emph{factor} times, creating multiple instances of the loop body, that can then be scheduled independently or run in parallel.
	\item \textbf{Loop Flatten:} Allows perfectly nested loops, loops that no logic is injected between them, to get collapsed into a single loop, reducing latency. Essentially, it handles all the indexing logic of the loop flattening.
	\item \textbf{Loop Merge:} Merges consecutive loops, often initialization loops, reducing overall latency and resource utilization.
	\item \textbf{Resource:} Specifies the resource for a variable to get implemented.
	\item \textbf{Array Partition:} By default, every array is implemented as a set of at least one BRAM unit with a single read and a single write port. The array partition directive partitions an array into multiple smaller arrays or assigns each array's element to its register. This partitioning increases the read and write ports of the array on the hardware level, allowing for parallel I/O and computations. In the potential expense of more memory instances and more register, array partitioning can improve overall throughput and performance of memory bounded applications.
	\item \textbf{Array Map:} The array map directive combines multiple small arrays into a single large one, to avoid BRAM waste on small arrays, which can occupy a BRAN unit for just a few elements.
	\item \textbf{Array Reshape:} Reshapes an array of many elements of small bit-width to an array of fewer elements but of higher bit-width, increasing the sequential BRAM access speeds.
	\item \textbf{Data Pack:} Similar to the array reshape directive, the data pack directive combines struct data fields to a single scalar of higher bit-width.
	\item \textbf{Dataflow:} Enables parallel execution of functions and loops, increasing throughput and latency.
	\item \textbf{Inline:} Similar to C/C++ macro preprocessor functionality, the inline directive injects a function's body to each of its calls, reducing latency and initiation interval due to lower function call overhead.
	\item \textbf{Allocation:} Limits the number of hardware resources used for implementing the IP block, and may result in hardware sharing and latency increase.
	\item \textbf{Latency:} Limits the minimum and maximum latency in clock cycles.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Xilinx SDK}
Xilinx Software Development Kit (SDK) \cite{Xilinx-SDK}, currently unified with SDSoC and SDAccel into Vitis Unified Software Platform, is an IDE for embedded-software development Xilinx's microprocessors. Based on the Eclipse IDE \cite{Eclipse-IDE}, it includes a C/C++ editor, a compilation toolchain for ARM microprocessors with automatic Makefile generation, system performance analysis and optimization tools, and several debug and profiling tools. It is used to create applications that run on the ARM cores either external to the FPGA die or internal like on the MPSoCs. Often those applications play the role of the coordinator/master that organizes, schedules, and configures the FPGA hardware. They often handle the external I/O, like data transfers to and from storage devices (SD cards, Hard Drives, Flash Memories, etc.) or Ethernet, to and from volatile memory (RAM, BRAM, etc.). They can also handle the data pre-processing needed to feed the FPGA hardware. Furthermore, multi-core processors can be utilized simultaneously using bare-metal applications. If multi-processing is required with a sophisticated scheduler, Linux applications can be built and run on Linux operating systems like PetaLinux \cite{PetaLinux} and FreeRTOS \cite{FreeRTOS}.

Xilinx SDK is strongly coupled with the Xilinx Design Suite and its hardware designs and bitstreams. After the successful implementation and bitstream generation of the hardware design from Vivado IDE, Xilinx SDK imports the project's hardware wrapper to generate the Board Support Package (BSP) and various C/C++ libraries useful for communication with and configuration of the FPGA hardware.

Xilinx SDK can create three main types of applications; bare-metal, First Stage Boot Loader (FSBL), and Linux applications. Their main difference is on the way the application is loaded onto the system's processor.
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Baremetal:} A bare-metal application is loaded using the SDK's built-in functionality that can program the FPGA (PL part) and load it onto the corresponding ARM core through the JTAG port.
	\item \textbf{FSBL:} A FSBL application is a set of files generated by the SDK that, when put on the root folder of the system's primary storage device, e.g., SD card, are read during the system's boot-up, triggering a boot loader sequence. The system has to be appropriately configured, typically configuring some jumpers and switches on development boards to instruct the processor to read the FSBL files. When the bootloader sequence is triggered, programming of the FPGA and loading the application are done using the primary storage device as a source, with no need for an external computer, and Xilinx SDK or JTAG.
	\item \textbf{Linux:} A Linux application is similar to the FSBL one, with the only difference that a Linux operating system is required to be running on the system's processor. Similarly, the Linux OS is loaded using the primary storage device. When Linux is fully loaded, the application can be started like any other Linux application through the provided console window to program the FPGA and run it.
\end{itemize}
A console window is used for input and output functionality using the UART port in all application types.

Debugging applications is as simple as regular locally running applications using the built-in System Debugger or other debugging tools like GDB \cite{GDB}. In addition, Vivado IDE's Hardware Manager can be used in combination with SDK's System Debugger to debug hardware designs and their driver applications. Vivado IDE's Hardware Manager connects to the hardware's ILA IPs, enabling the monitoring in real-time of the hardware's state concerning the driver application's state.

\section{FPGA Platforms}
\label{sec:FPGA-Platforms}
This work focuses on the two FPGA platforms available in the lab, the Xilinx ZCU102 Evaluation Kit, and the FORTH QFDB. Conveniently, both platforms integrate the same Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC XCZU9EG-2FFVB1156E.

\subsection{Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC XCZU9EG-2FFVB1156E}
The Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ Multi-Processor System-on-Chip (MPSoC) \cite{DS891-Zynq-UltraScale-MPSoC-DataSheet-Overview} family of products integrates multiple ARM Cortex-A53 and Cortex-R5 cores processing system (PS) and a Xilinx UltraScale programmable logic (PL) architecture in a single chip with on-chip memory, multiport external memory interfaces and several peripheral connectivity interfaces.

\subsection{Xilinx ZCU102 Evaluation Kit}
The Xilinx ZCU102 Evaluation Kit \cite{ZCU102-User-Guide} \cite{ZCU102-Product-Overview} (Figure \ref{fig:ZCU102-board-overview}) is a general-purpose development board for rapid prototyping based on the aforementioned UltraScale+ MPSoC. It provides a complete platform with an SD card as a primary storage device, 4GB 64bit ECC DDR4 SODIMM RAM, 512MB DDR4 component memory for PL, and a power delivery system.

\end{figure}

\subsection{FORTH QFDB}
The Quad-FPGA Daughter Board (QFDB) (Figure \ref{fig:forth-qfdb-daughterboard}) \cite{Implementation-and-Impact-of-an-Ultra-Compact-Multi-FPGA-Board-for-Large-System-Prototyping}, developed by the Foundation of Research and Technology Hellas (FORTH) \cite{FORTH}, combines four of the aforementioned MPSoCs, interconnected with each other. It is a complete platform as well, which provides 16GB of DDR4 memory and an M.2 Solid State Drive (SSD), and some peripherals and interfaces such as Ethernet, JTAG, and UART.

It is designed to be used in servers, with other QFDBs running in parallel, creating a network of FPGAs. The QFDB enables massive hardware designs to be split and deployed into multiple FPGA devices or even multiple QFDB boards. It also enables the deployment of hardware designs into a high number of FPGAs for increased parallelism.

\section{The platform}
For this work, a platform was created capable of CNN inference on FPGA devices. This platform had to be created with flexibility and versatility in mind to be able to be transferred to other FPGA devices while being based on the Xilinx ZCU102, which was available in the lab. It should also be scalable to enable multi-FPGA implementations, and it should be extendable to enable for easy adding of new layer types and new layer accelerators. Furthermore, it should be able to run various CNN models' inference, but most importantly, it should provide easy experimentation and development of accelerator architectures.

The basic building blocks of this platform consists of its volatile and non-volatile memory, and its compute engine. Figure \ref{fig:platform-block-diagram} depicts the platform's block diagram, whose functionality is explained below. It should be noted that everything described below is implemented on the aforementioned Xilinx ZCU102 Evaluation Kit.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Non-Volatile Memory}
This platform's non-volatile memory serves as a storage medium for all the data that networks require for their inference, which include the initialization data (network model configurations, parameters (weights and biases), class labels), and the input data (e.g., images). An SD-card is used as the non-volatile memory for this platform (also depicted as an SD-card in Figure \ref{fig:platform-block-diagram}). However, with some software extensions, other storage devices can also be used, such as SATA hard drives or even M.2 SSDs (on other FPGA platforms, e.g., QFDB). Moreover, external storage devices can also be utilized, via the Ethernet port through local-network/Internet, or via the JTAG port to avoid copying files over and over again on the platform's primary storage device but also to enable the single-source access for multiple FPGA devices.

While SD-cards have little bandwidth than other storage devices like SATA drives and M.2 SSDs, the non-volatile memory's purpose is to initialize the platform, which is a one time cost, and feed it with input data. When the platform is on its initialization phase, the initialization data from its non-volatile memory are transferred to its volatile memory to get later used from the compute engine. Because most, if not all, networks' initialization data fit in the volatile memory, leaving a lot of empty memory space, input data are also transferred, filling as much space as possible to utilize the volatile memory's high bandwidth for input data consumption. Consequently, the SD-card's low bandwidth can be safely ignored.

If the input data are large enough to not completely fit in the volatile memory and their consumption is faster than their feed through the SD-card, a faster storage device should be used. However, in this work's experiments, this has never been the case.

\subsection{Volatile Memory}
The platform's volatile memory consists of two types of memory devices, the DDR4 modules found on the ZCU102 and the on-chip BRAM. The ZCU102 also provides a separate DDR4 component accessible from the FPGA's PL part, however for simplicity and generality (it is not provided on all FPGA platforms) purposes, and because it provides lower bandwidth compared to the DDR4 modules, it is not utilized on this platform.

The platform's primary memory medium is the DDR4 memory modules connected to both the PS and PL parts of the device. As mentioned before, it stores and serves all the required data for the platform to run. Those data are read from various files found on the non-volatile memory, in this case, the SD-card, using the Arm cores found on the PS part, and are then stored onto the DDR.

The DDR has to feed the PL part with data in chunks because, as explained in section \ref{sec:Memory-Footprint}, the integrated BRAM cannot store the whole network's parameters and activations. Consequently, every network's layer has to know where to find and how to access every piece of data it requires, which is found on the platform's software structures.

On this platform, there is no central BRAM component that every accelerator accesses. Instead, every accelerator should implement its own BRAM, without permitting access to others. It should be the only one to know how to manage its storage. Of course, to fulfill the accelerator's needs in bandwidth, read and write ports, and latency, it can implement its BRAM as it requires, and utilize individual registers.

\subsection{Compute Engine}
The compute engine consists of both the PS and PL part of the FPGA device, which includes the Arm cores and the FPGA accelerators, respectively. While the bulk of the computation is handled by the PL part, the PS part handles the more sophisticated computations, such as the input data pre-processing and the accelerator configuration and scheduling.

In this platform, a network can be run only if its layers are supported by either software or hardware implementations. Software implementations are running on the Arm cores, and hardware implementations are the FPGA accelerators. By allowing both types of implementations, this platform expands its flexibility. This can not only help the development stage of FPGA accelerators by comparing their outputs with the ones generated by the software implementation, but it can also help to fully utilize the device's resources by running parts of even whole layers on the Arm cores in parallel to the hardware accelerators. Furthermore, layers that have not yet been implemented in hardware can easily be implemented in software for experimentation purposes, such as the Depth Concat layer found on the GoogLeNet (Figure \ref{fig:GoogLeNet}).

As shown in Figure \ref{fig:platform-block-diagram}, in this work, three layer types have been implemented in hardware; the Convolutional (Conv) layer, the Max-Pooling (MaxPool) layer and the Fully-Connected (Linear) layer. In addition, multiple instances of the same layer type can also be added in the platform to enable for either parallel execution of different inferences with different inputs or even different network models, or better pipelining in a single inference. This is discussed in detail in section \ref{sec:CNN-Scheduling}.
